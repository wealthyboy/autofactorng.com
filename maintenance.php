<h2 class="page_sub_header">Every Month</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Tire Inflation and Status<br></b></li>
		Check the pressure of all tires, including the spare. Check the tread for uneven or irregular wear 
		and cuts or bruises along the side of the tire. Inflate tires and maintain at recommended pressure. 
		Replace tires if worn or damaged.
	
	<li><b>Cleaning and Polishing<br></b></li>
		To prevent fading of your vehicle's glossy surface, use only automotive car wash products, not 
		dishwashing liquids. Polish at least twice a year to maintain and protect the gloss finish.

	<li><b>Check Engine Light On<br></b></li>
		If check engine indicator light comes on while driving or remains on, your vehicle may have an 
		emissions or sensor problem and should be analyzed. If light flashes, the condition is more 
		severe and must be checked immediately to prevent any damage.

	<li><b>Windshield Washer Fluid<br></b></li>
		Check fluid level monthly. Do not use water. Use washer fluid only.
</ul>
