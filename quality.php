	<li><span>Quality is associated with consistency. A client who is satisfied and happy with the first buying 
	experience needs and wants to be equally happy on each further occasion. Or even happier. The 
	only time when inconsistency is welcome is when quality improves. Going below the standards 
	is unacceptable and may take your business to ruins. Most clients who really care about quality 
	are willing to pay a bit more to obtain it and see ‘the extras’ as worth the additional expense.
